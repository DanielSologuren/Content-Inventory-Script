Content-Inventory-Script
========================

This shell script expands the "find" command to extract components for a content inventory.

HOW TO USE:
  1. Open in terminal the folder/site you want to create the inventory with.
  2. Run the command: acompli.sh > [YOUR FILE].txt
  3. This saves the output result into a .txt file
  4. Import this txt file into Excel
  5. Pat yourself on the back.


NOTES:
* When dealing with content in Excel, it would be best to make the content into a data table so that the rows can
remain uniform when makeing several changes
* This is not meant to get 100% perfect results. The automation of doing this content inventory is to do 90% of the
work and make you do the last 10%.
