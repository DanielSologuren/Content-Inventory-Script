Content-Inventory-Script
========================

This shell script expands the "find" command to extract components for a content inventory.

HOW TO USE:
1) Open in terminal the folder/site you want to create the inventory with
2) Run shell script (Make sure to export and save to txt file) --- hello.sh >content.txt
3) Open up Microsoft Excel and import txt file (this may take a while given how big it is).


NOTES:
* When dealing with content in Excel, it would be best to make the content into a data table so that the rows can
remain uniform when makeing several changes
* This is not meant to get 100% perfect results. The automation of doing this content inventory is to do 90% of the
work and make you do the last 10%.
