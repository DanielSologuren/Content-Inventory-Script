        <p><b>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION</b>
        <p>Since publication of the <i>Guide to Implementing the Core Food
        Security Module </i>in 1997 by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS,
        previously Food and Consumer Service) of the U.S. Department of
        Agriculture (USDA), the standard procedures for measuring food
        insecurity and hunger have undergone further refinement and development
        based on ongoing research within the federal interagency Food Security
        Measurement Project. This new edition of the <i>Guide </i>documents
        minor corrections and changes, bringing the procedures described in the
        original publication up to date. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small changes in the format of the core-module questionnaire for
            consistency with the form adopted in 1998 for standard use in the
            annual Food Security Supplement to the Census Bureau's Current
            Population Survey (CPS), and other applications;<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Significant simplification and streamlining of the recommended
            procedure for scoring households with partially missing data;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Revised and corrected scale-score ranges, based on 1998 data, for
            classifying households by food security status categories;<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>An alternative, simple method of assigning households with
            complete core-module data to the food security status-level
            classifications; and<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Brief information on adapting the measure for particular survey
            uses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of these changes alters the content of the food security
        core-module questionnaire, the scaling method underlying the food
        security scale, or the basic method of classifying households by food
        security status level. Consequently, data collections and analyses based
        on the original <i>Guide </i>and on this Revised Edition can be fully
        consistent (although users of the original <i>Guide </i>should note the
        corrected and updated scale-score ranges presented here).</p>
        <p>USDA actively encourages State- and local-area research and
        population monitoring applications of the standard national measure of
        household food security, as well as continued testing and validation
        research on the measure itself.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The ERS Food Security Briefing Room (<a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/foodsecurity/">www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/foodsecurity</a>)

        <p class="HdrBlackBold">
        <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
        </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presence of hunger in American households due to
        insufficient resources to obtain food has been a long-standing challenge
        to U.S. health, nutrition, and social policy. The success of the
        nation's nutrition-assistance safety net, beginning with the National
        School Lunch Program in 1946 and later under-girded by the Food Stamp
        Program and special programs for unusually vulnerable groups, has meant
        that extreme forms of hunger, common in Third-World countries, have been
        virtually eliminated in the United States. However, less severe forms of
        food insecurity and hunger--deprivation in basic need for food--are
        still found within the U.S. and remain a cause for concern. The basic
        policy tenet was forcefully stated by the President's Task Force on Food
        Assistance in 1984:</p>
        <i>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has long been an article of faith among the
        American people that no one in a land so blessed with plenty should go
        hungry. ...Hunger is simply not acceptable in our society.</p>
        </i>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Task Force also noted that, up to the time of its
        Report:</p>
        <p><i>There is no official &quot;hunger count&quot; to estimate the
        number of hungry people, and so there are no hard data available to
        estimate the extent of hunger directly. .... We regret our inability to
        document the degree of hunger caused by income limitations, for such
        lack of definitive, quantitative proof contributes to a climate in which
        policy discussions become unhelpfully heated and unsubstantiated
        assertions are then substituted for hard information.</i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now the tools do exist to document directly the
        extent of food insecurity and hunger caused by income limitations, as
        these conditions are experienced and reported by American households.
        Following the 1984 Task Force Report--indeed, in part stimulated by the
        report--private-sector researchers redoubled efforts to develop the kind
        of direct survey measure that could reliably and consistently document
        the extent of U.S. hunger. By the early 1990s, an extensive body of
        field experience had been gained and substantial consensus had emerged
        among nutrition experts on the sound conceptual and practical bases for
        such a measure. Meanwhile, Congress enacted the National Nutrition
        Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990, asserting the need for
        better monitoring and assessment of the nutritional state of the
        American people. The long-range plan formulated under the Act by the U.
        S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (DHHS)
        clarified the government's responsibility to help create a sound
        national measure of food insecurity and hunger. A key requirement was
        that this measure should be appropriate for standard, consistent use
        &quot;throughout the national nutrition monitoring system <b><i>and at
        State and local levels.&quot;</i></b>.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A federal interagency working group--the Food
        Security Measurement Project--was formed in 1992 to develop the needed
        measure, building upon the earlier research and working in close
        collaboration with private-sector experts and the U.S. Census Bureau.
        Throughout this development process, one objective held firmly in view
        was to make the final measure appropriate and feasible for use in
        locally designed and conducted food-security surveys.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that this objective is achieved with the
        food-security core survey module, which currently is being used
        successfully in local applications throughout the U.S. and Canada. While
        the module may seem unduly long and repetitive at first sight, it
        generally requires less than four minutes of survey time to
        administer--under two minutes average in a full population sample with
        screening--while offering important strengths not available from single
        or small sets of indicators. The key strength of the measure, as
        explained below, is that its multiple indicator questions capture and
        distinguish the <i>various levels of severity</i> throughout <i>the full
        range of severity</i> with which the phenomenon of food
        insecurity/hunger is experienced in U.S. conditions. This feature is
        critical for accurately assessing the<i> prevalence</i> of food
        insecurity because the greater the severity, the less the prevalence and
        each separate indicator captures a<i> different degree</i> of severity.
        The frequency of the various indicators varies widely depending upon <i>exactly
        which</i> level of severity each one reflects.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Food insecurity is a complex, multidimensional
        phenomenon which varies through a continuum of successive stages as the
        condition becomes more severe. Each stage consists of characteristic
        conditions and experiences of food insufficiency to fully meet the basic
        needs of household members, and of the behavioral responses of household
        members to these conditions. A variety of indicators is needed to
        capture the various combinations of food conditions, experiences, and
        behaviors that, as a group, characterize each such stage. This is what
        the 18-item &quot;core module&quot; set of indicators provides. The
        chapters below describe some of the characteristic aspects of the
        continuum of food insecurity and hunger, and Exhibit 3-2 (p.32)
        illustrates graphically the relationship of the food security measure to
        this continuum. An even larger, more detailed indicator set than the
        18-item standard U.S. food security scale might do an even better job of
        measuring the severity of food insecurity/hunger--e.g., it could
        distinguish more fully among the various time paths of the experience
        (cyclical, episodic, prolonged, brief but intense, etc.) and among the
        alternative behavioral paths that reveal the various coping strategies
        that households employ in attempting to deal with food-resource
        inadequacy. However, for the main purpose of assessing the prevalence of
        food insecurity/hunger at each of its several measurable levels of
        severity among U.S. households, the 18-item core module has been shown
        to be a stable, robust, and reliable measurement tool.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, for circumstances in which limitations
        on survey time are insurmountable, a standard 6-item subset of the
        core-module indicator questions also has been developed, designed to
        capture reliably the first two thresholds identified in the full
        continuum measured by the food-security/hunger scale--i.e., the
        threshold of identifiable household food insecurity and the threshold of
        identifiable hunger among household members. Testing has shown this
        standard subset (Appendix B) to be significantly more reliable in
        classifying households accurately to the appropriate food security
        status level than alternative small, idiosyncratic sets of food-security
        indicators selected on impressionistic or &quot;face-validity&quot;
        grounds alone.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local surveys that employ the systematic, tested, and
        validated indicator set provided by the core module for food security
        measurement, or the reduced standard 6-item partial set, can obtain
        findings that are readily interpretable. Such local survey findings can
        be compared directly with national and state-level standard benchmark
        statistics published annually by USDA and with many national- or
        regional-level tabulations of population subgroups available in the USDA
        reports. This food security benchmark data series is available from the
        U.S. Census Bureau, by CD-ROM or at the Bureau's web-site <a href="http://www.census.gov">www.census.gov</a>
        or <a href="http://ferret.bls.census.gov">http://ferret.bls.census.gov</a>.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an additional strength for comparative research
        with local survey findings, data from the standard food security Core
        Module also will be available from several specialized national surveys:
        the 5-year longitudinal Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD, conducted by
        the Census Bureau for DHHS, Office of the Assistant Secretary for
        Planning and Evaluation), the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS,
        conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for
        Educational Statistics), the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by
        Individuals (CSFII), and the DHHS 4th National Health and Nutrition
        Examination Survey (NHANES-4).</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Core Module has been designed, not only for use
        in national surveys, but also for local groups wanting to determine the
        extent and severity of food insecurity and hunger within their own
        communities, using a technically well grounded and tested method to
        produce local prevalence estimates comparable with national and
        state-level standard benchmark figures. Local studies using either the
        Core Module or the standard 6-item subset can play a key role in
        documenting the presence of hunger in the community as measured under
        standard national practice, in providing a sound base for broader
        community needs assessment, and in helping focus attention on unmet
        food-security needs within the community. When the Core Module is used
        to collect data on a periodic basis--as USDA is doing for national and
        state levels with the annual Food Security Supplement to the Current
        Population Survey--it also can provide systematic monitoring of the
        community's progress in addressing the hunger and other food-security
        needs within its midst.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next section (Chapter 1) presents the background
        description of food security measurement, slightly edited, from the 1997
        <i>Guide to Implementing the Core Food Security Module.</i> The second
        chapter describes the data collected with the core module survey
        instrument. Chapter 3 gives updated guidance on how to score data
        collected with the module to produce prevalence estimates for food
        insecurity and hunger within the sampled population. The final chapter
        offers brief preliminary guidance on procedures for sampling within
        local population groups to assure that findings obtained from
        food-security surveys can be accurately interpreted and to avoid making
        unsupportable generalizations from the data collected.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, we recommend that any local group
        planning a food security survey seek to work cooperatively with
        university or other resource persons experienced in sample-survey work.
        Numerous sampling methods are available that are feasible and that can
        yield meaningful results, but expertise is needed to design these
        methods into your planned survey. Some experienced guidance at the
        initial planning and design stage of the study will pay off handsomely
        in helping to assure that the survey findings you obtain serve the
        purposes you intend, and that you and others can make valid
        interpretations of the findings.
